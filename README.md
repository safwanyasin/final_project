## Final Project
This is my graduation project that I developed in Sabanci University. This repository includes the software for a human following robot. Over the course of two semesters, I made several revisions to the software in order to add more features and ensure that ran harmoniously with the hardware designed by my groupmates. The final version of the software is in the file named `human_follower_flaskv2.0.py`.
